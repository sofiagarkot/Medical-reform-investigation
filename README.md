# Medical-reform-investigation
This project is made for deeper investigation of medical systems in the world. We are mostly concentrated on answering to the question: why Ukraine does not have an efficient medical system yet? By finding out which factors and steps were the most crucial for a successful reform in developed countries as well as comparing to the experience of similar to Ukraine countries we will provide an analysis and make conclusions about which steps are likely to succeed and which -- to fail in the new reform of healthcare system.
